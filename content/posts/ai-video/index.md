In October of 2023, the UVU Digital Transformation team wanted to share a cyber security message. Specifically, we needed to warn our campus community about the real threats we were seeing regarding attackers shifting to SMS Phishing and the new AI attack vectors on the horizon. With the permission of President Tuminez, we used an online service to clone her voice using 3 minutes of publicly available audio from YouTube. Only at the end of the video is it revealed that it had not been her narrating it. Thanks go out to [UVU Studios and Broadcast Services](https://www.uvu.edu/directory/department/?id=51100) for the help with the animations and putting the audio into a compelling video.
